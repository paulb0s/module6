            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Paul, and I'm a 23-year-old Business Information Technology student currently in my first year
                of studies.
                When I'm not studying, I enjoy spending my time hanging out with friends, playing video games, and
                producing electronic music.
                I enjoy collecting plushies with my partner, and our goal is to create an army of them someday! Every
                type of plushie is up for recruitment, as long as they're cute in their own way.</p>
            <p>Beside all that, I also enjoy exploring all kinds of things about video game consolesâ€”whether it's
                modding the software or tinkering
                with hardware, I find it all very interesting.<br>
                Despite being a bit reserved and bashful by nature, I love pushing myself to meet new people and form
                meaningful connections.
                Traveling is something I truly enjoy, and I've been lucky enough to explore several different countries
                around the world in my life.
                I feel that there's always something new to learn and experience around the globe, and I'm always up for
                the chance to find out more.</p>

            <h2>Steps for a berry smoothie:</h2>
            <p>One thing about me, I sure love smoothies! In fact, I love them so much that they're pretty much all I
                have for
                breakfast nowadays. So, in order to make one of my easy & quick to make smoothies, all you'll have to do
                is follow this
                recipe!<br><br>
                First, you start out by gathering all the ingredients that I've listed into one convenient place. After
                that, you can start getting your blender ready for use.<br><br>
                Now you can pour into the blender about 2 dl of oatmilk. The more oatmilk you use, the runnier the
                texture of the smoothie will be, so add to your liking.<br><br>
                Next, you can add in your berries, a handful or two should get the job done. You can use any berries, it
                depends on what you personally prefer in this context.
                I personally like to use a mix of blueberries, strawberries and bananas &#40;yes, I know, they aren't
                berries&#41;, but sometimes I'll switch out the bananas for raspberries!<br><br>
                Next, you're going to want to add in the greek yoghurt. The more you add, the thicker the texture is
                going to be. I normally don't measure the amount, I just kind of eyeball it, but about 5-6 tablespoons
                have cut it for me &#40;or 125 grams if you need exact numbers&#41;.<br><br>
                After this, you can add about 2-3 tablespoons of honey into the mix, but this is only an estimate, you
                can add as much as you like, the more you add, the sweeter the smoothie gets!<br><br>
                Now comes the loud part: time to mix! Give the blender a spin, and mix until everything has blended into
                a fine liquid.<br><br>
                You've successfully made yourself a nice, sweet smoothie! Enjoy!
